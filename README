NOTE: This has only been tested with Java 8. Gradle build is failing on Java 11 and I have not
bothered to look into a solution. The windows timing code was tested in IntelliJ, not through 
calling gradles from the command line.

In order to run this using gradle:
    In the root of this directory:
        gradle -PmainClass=Runner execute

The repo should load up as an IntelliJ project if you would prefer to run it that way.
